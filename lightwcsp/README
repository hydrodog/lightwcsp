The Lightweight C++ Server Pages project is an ultra-high performance web serverwritten in C++. It is very limited at the moment, but very fast.

We are adding an integrated security mechanism that will quickly handle the following requests

1. Simple page requests.  These are serviced without checking
2. Secure page requests.  These are services after checking whether this user is allowed acces.
3. Dynamic pages through JSP-like implementation in C++.
