The Lightweight C++ Server Pages project is an ultra-high performance web server written in C++.
Designed by Dov Kruger at Stevens Institute of Technology.
Four people have worked on this project:

Dov Kruger
Andres Contreras
Junyang Zheng
Marco Brunoro Thome

LCSP is limited at the moment, but very fast.  Current functionality:
1. Simple page request preloading files into RAM for speed with a single send for small files
2. Secure checking for filenames by preloading files.
3. Integrated benchmarking.
4. Dynamic pages through a JSP-like implementation

New features under construction:

1. Security manager: Simple page requests.  These are serviced without checking
2. Security manager: Secure page requests.  These are services after checking whether this user is allowed acces.
3. SSL encryption
4. Hardware Optimization of AES-256 (see hardware team separately)
5. New template language and high performance protocols
